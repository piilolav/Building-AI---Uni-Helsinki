# Flood risk detection 

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Aim is to investigate flood risk in a certain location using machine learning tecnhiques. Results could be used to identify potential flood risk areas, find ways to mitigate risk in this specific location and possibly find early indicators of increasing risks. 


## Background

Flood risks are one of the most common natural disasters and there are indicators that climate change might alter the risks in different areas in the future.

Some problems one could possibly investigate:
* What areas are currently high, moderate or low risk areas (in Finland)?
* What indicater could warn us early of a potential flood?


## How is it used?

This approach could provide insurance companies, building companies, banks or even household buyers additional tools evaluating the flood risk of the property the engaging with. 


## Data sources and AI methods

Insurance companies hold lots of potentially interesting data. Open source data could be available from local metheorological institutes.
Contents and dataformats might vary a lot country by country. 

Interesting data to be considered could be:
* rainfall amounts
* temparature changes
* humidity
* nearby sea level
* snow amount at nearby mountain peaks

Some methods worth considering could be:
* k-Nearest Neighbours
* Support Vector Machine

## Challenges

It is likely that areas of interest and severity of flood risk are to change due climate change. It might be that ML-approaches might not recognice the

## What next?

Potentially data gathering and searching what kind of open data there is to get started with.
